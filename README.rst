PROJECT STATUS
===================
This module is a mess, a functional mess, but still a mess.... As I have time, I'm rewriting it and the 0.5.x
branch is much improved.


I've been working on a REST JSON webservice powered by this package, its a working prototype at the moment
but if you interested, let me know.


CURRENT BUILD STATUS:

As of 0.5.x this package has 100% test coverage, every commit is built and tested in both python 2 and python 3.
