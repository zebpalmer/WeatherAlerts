Please note:
===================
Haven't had much time to work with this project over the last few months. 
But now that I do, I'm starting a COMPLETE rewrite. If you want a working copy of the code you can install via pip (See below)
or download Tag 0.4.7 on github.


Documentation
==============
Please see http://weatheralerts.readthedocs.org for current documentation


About
======
This python module started as part of another project of mine. But since this is more useful as a standalone module,
I've decided to move it to it's own project and open source it. As this is a alpha/beta release aspects of the project will change, 
and probably pretty often. Check back here for updates, if you install using pip, you can run ``pip install -U weatheralerts`` to get the latest version. 

Since this project gets it's data from the National Weather Service XML/CAP feed, it's free and straight from the source.
Other modules I've seen (or written) get data from 3rd parties that require an API key which in many cases requires a subscription or imposes restrictions on use.   

This code is provided under GPLv3 (see LICENSE.txt). If you do make improvements, please contribute back to this project. I certainly welcome new features, improvments and of course bug fixes. You can submit a git pull request or email me: zeb@zebpalmer.com

This project lives at `github.com/zebpalmer/WeatherAlerts <http://github.com/zebpalmer/WeatherAlerts>`_  For current documentation, visit the online docs at http://weatheralerts.readthedocs.org/


Install
---------
You can download and install via PIP by runing:  ``pip install -U weatheralerts``


Python 2 Support
-----------------
Development of this program is done in Python 3. However the installer supports python 2 and with each major/minor release I'll backport changes to the python2 code base. 
I'm currently building and testing for Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2. Essentially, it should work on anything 2.6 or newer. 




This program is maintained by Zeb Palmer, a Linux Systems Engineer and Professional Photographer who writes a bit of python at work and play.
